# Kotka

## Archival

This project has been archived due to both the reverse engineering of the Perl code being too complex for my current level of skill and finding a project that does what I intended to do, but do it better than I imagined I could have.
Please consider checking out said project [here](https://github.com/StarfishXeno/sotor).

A WIP Save Editor for Star Wars Knight of the Old Republic 1 and 2.

This work is based on [KSE](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/503-kotor-savegame-editor/) as their work is [open source](https://gitlab.com/kotorsge-team/kse).

However this work is entirely Windows based. I intend to make a multiplatform GUI + CLI tool for editing KotOR saves. You can view the development of such things here.

The original source code uses the [GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) license and I must do the same.
